# Detecting Equipment Availability in Gym!

This project aims to reduce the waiting time for gym-goers by providing real-time updates on equipment availability. The system utilizes a live-broadcast window that displays the availability status of gym equipment with images and names. The core of the project involves training a model to recognize images of gym equipment in occupied and unoccupied states. Using this trained model, real-time detection is performed on video feeds and images to determine the current status of the equipment. The results are shown in a window that updates every second, displaying images and names of unoccupied equipment. This system not only enhances the gym experience by minimizing wait times but also optimizes the utilization of gym resources.
